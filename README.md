# governors-mansions
Records of current and past governor's mansions in the United States.

## Summary
In the United States, governors often reside in an official residence maintained by the state. These residences are commonly referred to as "governor's mansions". Despite the history of these mansions, few datasets exist to describe them on a national level. As of 2022, five states do not maintain official gubernatorial residences: Arizona, Idaho, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Several states maintain multiple: Alabama, Michigan, New Jersey, and North Carolina.

## Sources
Data originate from state public records. When coordinates and square footage were not available, estimates were made using mapping tools accounting for the curvature of the earth. State-level median values for home prices and sizes were determined from 2021 federal economic data. "In use" values indicate whether or not a governor resides in that residence.
